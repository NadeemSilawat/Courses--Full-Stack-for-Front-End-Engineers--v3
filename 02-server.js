//What is Server ?
    // A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers.   


//Basic node server 
        // Make a file called simpleServer.js
        // Creating a simple HTTP server using Node.js running on port 3000
