    Dockers :- Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly.
               Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the 
               software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

    1.) Amazon ECS
    2.) Apache
    3.) CoreOS rkt


    // containers :-

    => Lightweight
    => portable
    => easier for development
    => easier to manage
    => faster startup
    => Decouple application from infrastructure
